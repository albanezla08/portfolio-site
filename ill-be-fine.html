									<p>I'll Be Fine is a tower defense game I made with 3 other designers as part of a project in our program, the School of Interactive Arts, for the annual Games for Change Festival. You follow the inner emotions of a single mother during the pandemic as you keep stressors out of her mind and gradually realize that mental health is about more than putting up walls.</p>
									<p>I was responsible for systems such as menus, buying/placing towers, dialogue, and enemy spawning as well as the controls. Additionally, I contributed to aspects of the game and narrative design, such as theming, storyboarding, map layout and tower abilities. This project was coded with Unity using C#.</p>
									<p>Through this project, I gained much experience collaborating with other designers and planning development to meet our deadline of 3 months. On a technical level, it was a great way to practice vector math for systems related to the isometric grid and systems design overall to manage all the moving parts and their interactions.</p>
